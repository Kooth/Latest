# Latest
Find the latest (newest) file and use it
The Latest script finds the latest (newest) file system object in the current directory.  An optional file pattern may be specified as the
last argument on the command line.  UNIX wildcard characters are accepted.  By default, a regular file is checked.  The Latest script
passes the "type" flag to the UNIX find(1) command.

Run Latest -h to show the options that are available with this command.  You can install this command with the "-I" option.
